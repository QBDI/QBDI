CHANGELOG
=========

Next Release
------------

* Introduce ``VMState.returnAddressPtr`` and ``VMState.returnAddressValue`` (only with ``EXEC_TRANSFER_CALL``)

Version 0.8.0
-------------

2021-02-11 QBDI Team <qbdi@quarkslab.com>

* Fix android compilation (`#126 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/126>`_)
* Fix instrumentation of Pusha and Popa on X86 (`#127 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/127>`_)
* Fix getBBMemoryAccess (`#128 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/128>`_)

  * Improve the documentation of getBBMemoryAccess
  * Add recordMemoryAccess callback before any InstCallback

* Refactor ExecBlockManager to work with unaligned instruction on X86 and X86-64 (`#129 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/129>`_)
* Drop early support for ARM. The support hasn't been tested since 0.6.2.
* Rework cmake package export to import X86 and X86_64 version of QBDI in one CMake (`#146 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/146>`_ and `#132 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/132>`_)
* Add :cpp:func:`QBDI::VM::getCachedInstAnalysis` to retrieve an InstAnalysis from an address. The address must be cached in the VM. (`#148 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/148>`_)
* Change in ``InstAnalysis`` and ``OperandAnalysis`` (`#153 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/153>`_):

  * Add ``InstAnalysis.flagsAccess`` to determine if the instruction uses or sets the flags (``EFLAGS`` register). The analysis ``ANALYSIS_OPERANDS`` is needed to use this field.
  * Change ``InstAnalysis.mayLoad`` and ``InstAnalysis.mayStore`` definition. The field will be true if QBDI detects memory access for the instruction.
  * Add ``InstAnalysis.loadSize`` and ``InstAnalysis.storeSize``. If the instruction will read or write the memory, the expected size of the access is given by these fields.
    The analysis ``ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTION`` is needed to use this field.
  * Add ``InstAnalysis.condition``. With the update of LLVM, the mnemonic for conditional jump (like ``JE_4``) are merged in a unique mnemonic ``JCC_4``.
    This new field will contain the condition.
    The analysis ``ANALYSIS_INSTRUCTION`` is needed to use this field. A new enum ``ConditionType`` has all the possible value.
  * Add ``OPERANDFLAG_IMPLICIT`` for ``OperandAnalysis.flag``. An operand will have this flag when a register is implicit to the instruction.
  * Add ``OPERAND_FPR`` for ``OperandAnalysis.type``. This type is used for floating point registers.
    For this type, ``OperandAnalysis.regCtxIdx`` is the offset in ``FPRState`` or -1 when an offset cannot be provided.
  * Add ``OPERAND_SEG`` for ``OperandAnalysis.type``. This type is used for segments or other unsupported register (like ``SSP``).
  * Change type of ``OperandAnalysis.regCtxIdx`` to signed integer. When the value is less than 0, the index is invalid.
  * Change algorithm for ``OperandAnalysis``. The type ``OPERAND_INVALID`` may be present in the list of operands when a register is unset with the current instruction.
    Many operands may describe the used of the same register when a register is used multiple times for different purposes by the instruction.

* Add Instrumentation rule callback :c:type:`QBDI_InstrRuleDataCBK` and :cpp:type:`QBDI::InstrRuleDataCBK` (`#151 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/151>`_)

  The Instrumentation rule callback receives an InstAnalysis of each instruction during the instrumentation process. Based on this analysis, the callback
  may insert custom InstCallback for each instruction.

  The call order of the callback has changed for the PREINST callback. If an instruction has multiple callbacks in PREINST position, they will be called
  in the reverse order of registration.

* Support SIMD MemoryAccess and change :cpp:struct:`QBDI::MemoryAccess` structure (`#154 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/154>`_)

  * Add :cpp:member:`QBDI::MemoryAccess::flags`. In some cases, QBDI cannot provide all information about the access. This field
    describes the limitation for each access. Three limitations may be reached:

    * :cpp:enumerator:`QBDI::MemoryAccessFlags::MEMORY_UNKNOWN_SIZE`: the size of the access isn't known. Only the address is valid.
      The flag is only set for instruction with REP prefix before the execution of the instruction.
    * :cpp:enumerator:`QBDI::MemoryAccessFlags::MEMORY_MINIMUM_SIZE`: the size isn't the real size of the access, but the expected minimal size.
      This flag is used for instruction with complex access like ``XSAVE`` and ``XRSTOR``.
    * :cpp:enumerator:`QBDI::MemoryAccessFlags::MEMORY_UNKNOWN_VALUE`: the value of the access hasn't been saved.
      The more common reason is that the access size is greater than the size of :cpp:member:`QBDI::MemoryAccess::value`.
      This flag is also used for instruction with REP prefix when the access size cannot be determined during the instrumentation.

  * Fix MemoryAccess for some generic instruction.

* Add VM Options. (`#144 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/144>`_)

  Some options can be provided to the VM to enable or disable some features:

  * :cpp:enumerator:`QBDI::Options::OPT_DISABLE_FPR`: Disable FPRState backup and restore in context switches.
    Only the GPRState will be used.
  * :cpp:enumerator:`QBDI::Options::OPT_DISABLE_OPTIONAL_FPR`: When :cpp:enumerator:`QBDI::Options::OPT_DISABLE_FPR` isn't selected,
    QBDI will detect if a BasicBlock needs FPRState. When BasicBlock doesn't need FPRState, the state will not be restored.
    This option forces the restoration and backup of FPRState to every BasicBlock.
  * :cpp:enumerator:`QBDI::Options::OPT_ATT_SYNTAX` for X86 and X86_64: :cpp:member:`QBDI::InstAnalysis::disassembly` will be in
    AT&T syntax instead of Intel Syntax.

* Rework documentation (`#156 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/156>`_)

Internal update:

* Update LLVM to LLVM 10.0.1 (`#104 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/104>`_ and `#139 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/139>`_)
* Reduce LLVM library included in QBDI static library and reduce QBDI package size (`#139 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/139>`_ and `#70 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/70>`_)
* Replace GTest by `Catch2 <https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2>`_ (`#140 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/140>`_)
* Refactor code and switch to cpp17 (`#140 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/140>`_ and `#155 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/155>`_)
* Use Github Actions to build dev-next package of QBDI (linux, osx and android) and PyQBDI (linux and osx) (`#147 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/147>`_, `#159 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/159>`_)
* Rewrite frida-qbdi.js and use sphinx-js for frida-QBDI documentation (`#146 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/146>`_).
  A version of frida greater or equals to 14.0 is needed to run frida-qbdi.js (need support of ES2019).
* Refactor MemoryAccess Code and add new tests (`#154 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/154>`_)
* Handle VMCallback return value (`#155 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/155>`_)
* Optimize Context Switch and FPRState restoration (`#144 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/144>`_)

Version 0.7.1
-------------

Version 0.7.0
-------------

2019-09-10 QBDI Team <qbdi@quarkslab.com>

* Add support for the x86 architecture
* Add new platforms related to Android: android-X86 and android-X86_64
* Improve :c:type:`MemoryMap` structure by adding the module's full path if available
  (`#62 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/62>`_, `#71 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/71>`_)
* Create docker images for QBDI (available on DockerHub `qbdi/qbdi <https://hub.docker.com/r/qbdi/qbdi>`_)
  (`#56 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/56>`_)
* Fix and improve operands analysis involved in memory accesses (`#58 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/58>`_) :

  In the previous version, the output of the instruction analysis for **some** instructions did not contain the information
  related to memory accesses.

  For instance, the *operand analysis* of ``cmp MEM, IMM`` misses information about the first operand:

  .. code:: text

      cmp dword ptr [rbp + 4 * rbx - 4], 12345678
          [0] optype: 1, value : 12345678, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0

  This issue has been fixed and the :c:type:`OperandAnalysis` structure contains a new  attribute: ``flag``,
  which is used to distinct :c:type:`OperandAnalysis` involved in memory accesses from the others.

  Here is an example of output:

  .. code:: text

      cmp dword ptr [rbp + 4*rbx - 4], 12345678
          [0] optype: 2, flag: 1, value : 48, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 14, regName: RBP, regaccess : 1
          [1] optype: 1, flag: 1, value : 4, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0
          [2] optype: 2, flag: 1, value : 49, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 1, regName: RBX, regaccess : 1
          [3] optype: 1, flag: 1, value : -4, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0
          [4] optype: 1, flag: 0, value : 12345678, size: 4, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0
      mov rax, qword ptr [rbp - 4]
          [0] optype: 2, flag: 0, value : 47, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: RAX, regaccess : 2
          [1] optype: 2, flag: 1, value : 48, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 14, regName: RBP, regaccess : 1
          [2] optype: 1, flag: 1, value : 1, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0
          [3] optype: 1, flag: 1, value : -4, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0
      mov rax, qword ptr [4*rbx]
          [0] optype: 2, flag: 0, value : 47, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: RAX, regaccess : 2
          [1] optype: 1, flag: 1, value : 4, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0
          [2] optype: 2, flag: 1, value : 49, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 1, regName: RBX, regaccess : 1
          [3] optype: 1, flag: 1, value : 0, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0
      jne -6115
          [0] optype: 1, flag: 2, value : -6115, size: 4, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0
      lea rax, [rbp + 4*rbx - 4]
          [0] optype: 2, flag: 0, value : 47, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: RAX, regaccess : 2
          [1] optype: 2, flag: 4, value : 48, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 14, regName: RBP, regaccess : 1
          [2] optype: 1, flag: 4, value : 4, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0
          [3] optype: 2, flag: 4, value : 49, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 1, regName: RBX, regaccess : 1
          [4] optype: 1, flag: 4, value : -4, size: 8, regOff: 0, regCtxIdx: 0, regName: (null), regaccess : 0


Version 0.6.2
-------------

* Add support for a public CI (based on Travis and AppVeyor)
* Fix instruction operands analysis (`#57 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/57>`_,
  `#59 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/59>`_)
* Add missing MEMORY_READ enum value in Python bindings (`#61 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/61>`_)

  `#51 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/51>`_)
* Add missing memory access instructions on x86_64 (`#45 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/45>`_,
  `#47 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/47>`_, `#72 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/pull/72>`_)
* Enable asserts in Debug builds (`#48 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/48>`_)

Version 0.6.1
-------------

2018-03-22 Charles HUBAIN <chubain@quarkslab.com>

* Fixing a performance regression with the addCodeAddrCB (`#42 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/42>`_):

  Since 0.6, this API would trigger a complete cache flush forcing the engine to regenerate
  all the instrumented code after each call. Since this API is used inside VM:run(), this
  had the effect of completely canceling precaching optimization where used.

* Fixing support for AVX host without AVX2 support (`#19 <https://github.com/QBDI/QBDI/issues/19>`_):

  Context switching was wrongly using AVX2 instructions instead of AVX instructions causing
  segfaults under hosts supporting AVX but not AVX2.

Version 0.6
